Modular test suite written in python for test driven development.

Create folder with tests titles names. You should then create one file
per tests. In order for your test to work you must respect the following
format :

The first line of your test should have the path through the binary you want to
compare your program to, separeted by a comma and the pass through your binary.

Example, for my bash implementation (42sh), my tests file were starting the
following way :
bash-c,./42sh -c

followed by your tests on the next line.
usage: test_suite.py [-h] [-l] [-c CATEGORY] [-t TIMEOUT] [-s] [-q]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l, --list            print category list
  -c CATEGORY, --category CATEGORY
                        only execute test of the specified category
  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        set timout for command in seconds
  -s, --sanity          run test with valgrind
  -q, --quiet           quiet mode
